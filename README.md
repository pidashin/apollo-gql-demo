# Introduction
This is a demo project that integrate a simple website with graphql api. <br />
I've use `react`, `redux` and `nextjs` to setup the website.
Use `apollo-server` to set up a graphql server, and use `prisma` to handle simple DB manipulations.
Also, i integrate `apollo-server` with a custom next server (`express` based).
As for client side, i've use `apollo-client` to handle graphql api.

# Start
to start the demo site, just run 

`yarn run start`

this will create the server on `localhost:3000`, and you could checkout the graphql interface though `localhost:3000/graphql`
